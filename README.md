# Iconic Soles Marketplace

This code provides a set of guidelines for buying and selling sneakers online. The code comprises two primary functions, namely addSneakers and buySneakers. The owner of the code can utilize the addSneakers function to add more sneakers to the market, while buyers can use the buySneakers function to purchase sneakers from the owner or other sellers.

The addSneakers function enables the owner to add new sneakers to the market, while the buySneakers function allows buyers to buy the sneakers they want. However, buyers must have sufficient "ether," to pay for the sneakers they wish to purchase.

Before initiating the buying process, the code ensures that the seller has enough sneakers to sell and the buyer has enough ether to buy the sneakers. Thus, this code acts as a set of instructions that promotes fairness and convenience in the online buying and selling of sneakers.
